"tango-morning" is a colorscheme inspired by the "morning" colorscheme by Bram.
The gui colors use the Tango Color palette, while the terminal colors are retained from the "morning" colorscheme.
The "morning" color scheme has problems in displaying diffs, which this theme tries to address, and uses elegant soft shades.
